## Description

Challenge made in 2 hours to show front-end skills in API connection. The purpose is to have a home screen that shows the Star Wars characters, with pagination and a link to direct the user to a page with a description of the character clicked.

The layout has not yet been implemented and as a future functionality improvement, it is still necessary to implement a search field.
